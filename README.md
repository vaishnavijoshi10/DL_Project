Technique Used:
CNN Architecture:
The first step in our methodology is to design a suitable CNN architecture for detecting
plant leaf diseases.We experiment with different hyperparameters and layers to optimize
the performance of the model. The rationale behind selecting this architecture is that it
has shown good performance in similar image classification tasks and has the capability
to learn complex features from images.

Hyperparameters:
The next step is to select suitable hyperparameters for our model, including the learning
rate, batch size, and number of epochs. We will use a grid search approach to find the
best combination of hyperparameters that maximizes the performance of the model. We
will also use techniques such as early stopping and learning rate scheduling to avoid
overfitting and improve the convergence of the model.

Dataset Preparation:
We will use a publicly available dataset such as PlantVillage or the Tomato Diseases
dataset for training and testing our model. We will split the dataset into training,
validation, and test sets using an 80-10-10 split. We will also apply data augmentation
techniques such as rotation, flipping, and cropping to increase the size and diversity of
the dataset.

Training and Validation:
We will use an adam optimizer with a categorical cross-entropy loss function to train our
model. During training, we will monitor the model's performance on the validation set
and use it to select the best model based on its accuracy and other metrics such as
precision and recall. We will also use techniques such as dropout and batch normalization
to improve the generalization and stability of the model.

Implementation:
We will implement our CNN model using a deep learning framework such as
TensorFlow. We will use a GPU-enabled computer to accelerate the training process and
reduce the computation time.

Model Evaluation:
We will evaluate the performance of our model on the test set using metrics such as
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We will compare the performance of our model
with state-of-the-art methods and discuss any significant differences observed. We will
also analyze the confusion matrix to identify which classes are most frequently
misclassified and suggest possible improvements.

Model Optimization:
We will experiment with various techniques to optimize the performance of our model,
including hyperparameter tuning, model ensembling, and transfer learning. We will also
experiment with different CNN architectures to see which one performs the best for our
specific task.

Computational Efficiency:
We will analyze the computational efficiency of our model, including the model size and
inference time. We will experiment with techniques such as model compression, pruning,
and quantization to reduce the size and improve the speed of our model while
maintaining its accuracy.

Overall, our methodology will involve designing and fine-tuning a CNN architecture,
selecting suitable hyperparameters, preparing the dataset, training and validating the
model, evaluating its performance, optimizing the model, analyzing the interpretability,
and improving the computational efficiency of the model.
